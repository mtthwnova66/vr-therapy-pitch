<body>
  <canvas id="global-backgroundCanvas"></canvas>
  <div class="main-content">
    ```

There are a few reasons this could happen:

1.  **JavaScript Interference:** Some script running on the page might be *removing* the canvas element after the initial HTML is parsed but before you inspect it.
2.  **Build Process Issue:** Since you mentioned Netlify, if there's a build step involved before the site is served locally, that build process might be altering the HTML and removing the canvas.
3.  **Browser Issue/Source Mismatch:** There might be a mismatch between the code file you are editing and what the browser is actually loading (e.g., caching issue, wrong file being served).

**Let's try these steps:**

**1. Verify the Source Code:**
   * In your browser (Chrome or Safari), right-click on the non-working page and select **"View Page Source"**.
   * A new tab/window will open showing the raw HTML code the browser received.
   * **Search** that source code (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F). Is the line `<canvas id="global-backgroundCanvas"></canvas>` actually present in the source code you are viewing?

**2. Test with NO Canvas JavaScript:**
   Let's see if the canvas element appears if we *only* have the HTML tag and the CSS, but *comment out* the JavaScript that tries to use it.

   * Use the **exact same HTML file from the previous step** (the one with no loading screen and the lime green CSS test).
   * Find the `initBackgroundCanvas()` function within the main `<script>` block at the bottom.
   * **Comment out the line that calls it** within the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener, like this:

   ```javascript
    // --- Initialization ---
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      try {
        // initBackgroundCanvas(); // <--- COMMENT THIS LINE OUT
        initNavigation();
        initDemoControls();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Initialization error:", error);
        const mainContent = document.querySelector('.main-content');
        if (mainContent) mainContent.style.opacity = '1';
      }
    });
